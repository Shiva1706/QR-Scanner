<h2>This is a simple QR Code Scanner app developed by using HTML, CSS and Javascript.</h2>

With this anyone can scan any QR and get realtime information of that.
<p>You can check the app here https://shiva1706.github.io/QR-Scanner/(not working becuase the qrserver api is having http instead of https protocol).</p>

So the better option is clone the project and run it at your localhost.
